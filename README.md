# Building in Public

Open-source and building in public is in our DNA. Now for the Developer Relations team as well.

In this repository we intend to gradually open-source all the documentation that we use internally and we believe we can have in public domain. 

The goal is to showcase our approach in Developer Relations and enable cross-pollination of different teams and projects. The community has played an integral part in making Netdata what it is today, so we try to give back at every turn.
